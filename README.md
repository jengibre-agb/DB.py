Small discord bot that just attempts to revive some old FB bots that died at some point (thanks Zuccerberg)

Couldn't find AnagramBot page




I do not own any of these pages, i just liked them while it was possible, I'm trying to bring them back since botmins are dead or something and i used to have a lot of fun
with them. Also thanks to the Bot Appreciation Society for sticking around all these years.


This bot also has some small functions that i conceived, some are yet to be finished; this repo will never receive an update since I do wanna publish it at some point
and I can't keep giving away all the ideas, mine or not.

You're free to use the code found here, don't forget to credit the original authors.


You can also invite it to your server if you will, it is obviously not finished

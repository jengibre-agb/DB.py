I do not own any of these bots, i just liked them while it was possible, I'm trying to bring them back since botmins are dead or something and i used to have a lot of fun
with them. Also thanks to the Bot Appreciation Society for sticking around all these years.


This bot also has some small functions that i conceived, some are yet to be finished; this repo will never receive an update since I do wanna publish the bot at some point
and I can't keep giving away all the ideas, mine or not.
